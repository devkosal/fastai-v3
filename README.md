# nyc-bridge-classifer

This repo holds the backend code for my NYC bridge classifer web app found here: 
https://nyc-bridge-classifier.onrender.com/

The app is trained to classify NYC bridges. There are 11 famous bridges in NYC. With this tool, you no longer have to wonder which bridge you are standing in front of!

Current model accuracy is at ~80%. 

For a list of the 11 bridges, visit https://streeteasy.com/blog/nyc-bridges-11-new-york-bridges/
